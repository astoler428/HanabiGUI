The GUI requires over 15 nested Panels, using inheritance and polymorphism. There are 29 classes and ~2000 lines of code.
I spent days creating upwards of 10 pages designing and organizing the project. 

The project simulates the card game Hanabi.
Hanabi is a cooperative card game from 2-5 players in which players take turns either playing a card, discarding a card or giving a clue to another player.
The project simulates players as if they were on different devices, opening multiple game windows from each player's perspective and having them communicate.
A deck is formed, players are created, hands are dealt, turns are determined and every aspect of the complex game is tracked, displayed and logged included:
  -The current player's turns
  -The clues marked in each person's hand
  -The number of cards left in the deck
  -The cards played on the stacks
  -The cards discarded in the discard pile
  -The number of clues, points and strikes
  -The game log displaying every action that takes place
  -Option click on your own cards to play or discard
  -Complex end of game checking based on cards maximum possible score remaining due to card discarded
  -AND MANY MORE subtleties of the rules of the game

Run HanabiGame.java to play
